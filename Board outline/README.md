Board outline for heart shaped PCBs
===================================

The shape is "drawn" in [Openscad](https://www.openscad.org/) (source file: [Heart.scad](./Heart.scad)) and then exported in [DXF](./Heart.dxf) and [SVG](Heart.svg) formats (see the [Makefile](./Makefile) for export commands).

The intention is to import the DXF into PCB design software and use it as a PCB's outline mechanical layer. For example the DXF file was imported into [Upverter](https://upverter.com/) to make [Heart PCB 1](../Heart-PCB-1) and [Heart PCB 2](../Heart-PCB-2).
