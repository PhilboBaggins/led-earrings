Board outline for Heart shaped PCB
==================================

The shape is "drawn" in [Openscad](https://www.openscad.org/) (source file: [Heart.scad](./Heart.scad)) and then exported in [DXF](./Heart.dxf) and [SVG](Heart.svg) formats (see the [Makefile](./Makefile) for export commands).

The intension is to import the DXF or SVG file into PCB design software as the PCB outline mechanical layer. For example the DXF file was imported into [Upverter](https://upverter.com/) to make [PCB 1](../PCB-1) and [PCB 2](../PCB-2).
